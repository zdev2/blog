summary: My very first blog post, marking the start of my blogging journey.

Every developer has their "Hello, World!" moment—the first taste of seeing something they wrote actually work. For me, that moment sparked a passion for web development, hardware tinkering, and pushing ideas beyond just "what's useful." So, welcome to my blog, where I document my journey, share my projects, and maybe inspire some curiosity along the way.

## **Who Am I?**

Hey, I'm a developer who enjoys **building, breaking, and fixing things.** My interests range from web development to embedded systems to photography. If it involves tech, I'll probably end up experimenting with it.

### **My Tech Stack & Interests**

- **Web Development** 🖥️  
  I mainly use C++, and C# for development. On the web side, I work with Go (Fiber) for the backend, React + Vite for the frontend, and MongoDB for databases. I'm also diving into Laravel when I need to mess with PHP.

- **Hardware & Embedded Systems** ⚙️  
  I love playing around with **Arduino, ESP32, and non-I2C LCD displays**. Some projects are practical, others are just for fun—because why not?

- **Photography & Videography** 📷  
  I use a **Sony A6400**, mainly for my personal photography and social media. I focus **60% on photography, 40% on videography**, and yeah, I'm a **pixel peeper** who obsesses over sharpness.

- **Self-Hosting & Server Stuff** 🌐  
  I run my own services on an **old PC with Docker**, setting up everything manually for full control. No third-party hosting for me!

## **Where It All Started**

Like most devs, I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, I discovered Go, and my first real web app came to life using Fiber. But before that, I also messed around with C++ and C#, thanks to a school learning game that I may or may not have modded. That was the moment I realized I could bend software to my will—and that I could build pretty much anything with code.

## **What I’m Working On**

- A **URL shortener** with analytics, QR codes, and IP-based geolocation.
- A **cashier system** with receipt generation, sales tracking, and user authentication.
- This **blog**, because why not document the journey?

## **Why This Blog?**

I made this blog to:

- **Share projects** 🛠️ (even the weird ones).
- **Document my learning process** 📖 (because debugging logs don’t tell stories).
- **Write about random things** 🤷 (not everything needs a reason).

## **What’s Next?**

Expect posts on **clean architecture, MongoDB tricks, camera settings, web dev experiments,** and whatever else catches my interest. If any of that sounds cool to you, stick around! 🚀
